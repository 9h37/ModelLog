### Remote logging clone howto (for rsyslog atleast)
#
#
# Client side:
#   Just add "*.* @remote-server" in /etc/rsyslog.conf, where "remote-server"
#   is a hostname (/etc/hosts) or an ip. "@" for udp, "@@" for tcp.
#
# Server side:
#   It has to be set up for listening (few lines to uncomment in rsyslog.conf).
# 
# Notes:
#   - *.* may be too permissive
#   - No restriction on the host sending the messages (security vulnerability).
#   - You will need to restart rsyslog if you edit /etc/rsyslog.conf or
#   /etc/hosts (/etc/hosts too because it looks like it is cached by rsyslog).
#   If "service rsyslog restart" fails like it does for me, try to reboot.
#   Logging out and logging in might work too. Yeah it looks noobish.
